# Shamir's Secret Sharing Scheme

Java implementation of Shamir's Secret Sharing Scheme.  See the [wikipedia article](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shamir's_Secret_Sharing) for details on the algorithm.  This implementation uses a BigInteger mod-prime polynomial.

## Maven
```xml
<dependency>
    <groupId>org.mitre.secretsharing</groupId>
    <artifactId>secret-sharing-scheme</artifactId>
    <version>1.2.0</version>
</dependency>
```

Snapshot builds are available on Sonatype's OSS snapshot repository:
```xml
<dependency>
    <groupId>org.mitre.secretsharing</groupId>
    <artifactId>secret-sharing-scheme</artifactId>
    <version>1.3.0-SNAPSHOT</version>
</dependency>
```

## Usage

Splitting a secret `byte[]` into parts:
```java
byte[] secret = ...;
Part[] parts = Secrets.split(secret);
```

Reconstructing a secret `byte[]` from parts:
```java
Parts[] parts = ...;
byte[] secret = Secrets.join(parts);
```

Converting a `Part` to a formatted `String`:
```java
Part part = ...;
String formatted = PartFormats.currentStringFormat().format(part);
```

Parsing a `String` to a `Part`:
```java
String formatted = ...;
Part part = PartFormats.parse(formatted);
```

## Command-line interface (CLI)

For your convenience, there is also a CLI version in artifact `org.mitre.secretsharing:secret-sharing-cli`. Even more comfortable is the shaded version (i.e. all dependencies included in the executable JAR) if you use classifier `shaded`:

```xml
<dependency>
    <groupId>org.mitre.secretsharing</groupId>
    <artifactId>secret-sharing-cli</artifactId>
    <classifier>shaded</classifier>
    <version>1.2.0</version>
</dependency>
```

You can use it like this:
```text
# Step A: split secret into 8 parts, require 5+ parts to re-roin 
java -jar secret-sharing-cli-1.2.0-shaded.jar split -t 8 -r 5 -p my-password- -s .txt
(Enter the password, press RETURN and then Ctrl-Z to finish input)

# Step B: gather 5+ files and re-join secret  
java -jar secret-sharing-cli-1.2.0-shaded.jar join -p my-password- -s .txt
(Password appears on screen)
```

Of course, you can also use input redirection instead of entering the password or other type of secret on the console.

## Security

Shamir's Secret Sharing Scheme is an [information-theoretically secure](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Information-theoretic_security) way to divide a secret into shareable parts.  For comparison, key-based cryptographic techniques are [computationally secure](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computational_hardness_assumption).

This Java implementation of the scheme has been reviewed by a MITRE cryptographer and found to be sound.  However, if you have any doubts, inspect the source code and compile it yourself.

This implementation of Shamir's Secret Sharing Scheme is not subject to export control laws in the United States of America.  Please check local laws concerning cryptography before downloading or using this library.

## Online Web Implementation

This implementation of the scheme [can be used in a web browser](http://secretsharing.org).  Use it at your own risk!  If your secret is truly secret then you shouldn't trust somebody else's webapp, and should instead download, inspect, and compile the code yourself.
